# Active Learning/Object Recognition CNN for Skin Lesions

Successfully implemented an active learning (semi-supervised) framework to help dermatologists spend less time labeling data. The app presented dermatologists with carefully selected unlabeled images that would be most beneficial to the model which was then used to generate a RetinaNet object detection/classification model with the aim of being implemented in practice. The end goal is to develop a lesion detecting/classification model that dermatologists can use to help with diagnoses.
